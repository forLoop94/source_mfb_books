# ðŸ“— Source MFB's Bookstore API Documentation

This documentation outlines the endpoints and usage for a basic Bookstore API. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books.

## API Base URL

The base URL for the API is https://localhost:5000/api.

## Authentication

The API does not require any form of authentication.

## Error Handling

- For invalid requests, the API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- For unexpected errors, the API returns a generic error message and an HTTP status code of 500 (Internal Server Error).
